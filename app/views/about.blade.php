		<h3>What is BackOrAttack?</h3>
		<p>BackOrAttack is a <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a> inspired <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> ranking site that can be used share and discover new youtube videos!</p>
		<p>BackOrAttack provides analytic information to display your impact on shared video and a valor points system (inspired by Reddit's Karma) to both reward and promote sharing videos. BackOrAttack was built using Laravel4 & bootstrap mainly as a side-project for me, <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/lucadecaprio/">Luca</a> to learn Laravel and improve my PHP skills.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h3>Whats to come?</h3>
	<p>I plan on supporting & improving BackOrAttack in the future because I believe its a useful tool for a more nieche users who loves <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> and want to stay up-to-date with viral and funny YouTubers.</p>
	<p>Based on feedback from the users I plan on improving & revamping the layout to a less boilerplate version of bootstrap.</p>
	<p>My goal is to eventually be able to grow this idea to a known platform for the YouTube community!</p>
